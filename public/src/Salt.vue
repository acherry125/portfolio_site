      Salt is a free web platform for students to plan for, pay for, and repay
      student loans. As a developer for American Student Assistance, I was one
      of three individuals responsible for the branding and styling of Salt from
      July 2016 to May 2018. Additionally, I was one of the team members
      responsible for the addition of new features to the Salt front-end
      javascript application which utilizes Backbone.js, dust.js, Highcharts.js,
      and jQuery. I also was expected to work in the node server that ran most
      of salt's dynamic routing. The content seen in the following screenshots
      is publically available at Salt by making a free account.
